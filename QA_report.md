## Functional Testing – Found Bugs

### 🐞 Bug 1 – Custom Chart Limit Not Communicated Clearly (Only 10 Rows Selectable)

**Description**:  
When selecting custom rows for charting in a report, the interface allows multiple selections but **silently restricts charting to only 10 rows**, without preventing the user from selecting more. This can confuse users expecting the full selection to be charted.

**Screenshot**:  
![Custom Chart Row Limit Bug](./screenshots/custom_row_limit.png)  
(_Observed message: "You can only select up to 10 rows for charting"_)

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Log in at [https://ua.segwise.ai](https://ua.segwise.ai)  
2. Open any saved report (e.g., "Copy of Creatives by Spend")  
3. Toggle "Show Chart" to **Custom**  
4. Begin selecting rows from the table — more than 10

**✅ Expected Result**:  
- Either the UI should **prevent selecting more than 10 rows**, OR  
- It should allow all selections but **display a warning/toast or auto-limit chart data cleanly**

**❌ Actual Result**:  
- User is allowed to select more than 10 rows
- Chart silently fails to reflect all selections or shows "No data found"

**🔧 Severity**: Medium  

**💡 Suggestion**:
- Prevent more than 10 selections programmatically (disable rest)
- Or show a persistent error/tooltip near chart controls
